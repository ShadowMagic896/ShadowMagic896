Hey :wave:, I'm ShadowMagic896

I like to make whatever I'm motivated to do.
Not open for employment.

### Stuff About Moi
I've been programming since August, 2021. I started out with 
Python, and eventually learned other langages like C#, Java, 
and Rust. As of writing, most projects that I create are
written in pure python but I would like to expand my
knowledge to other areas, especially lower-level languages.
<br/>
I like making bots for Discord. I'm currently working on 
[Builder](https://github.com/shadowmagic896/builder), though that's kinda halted due do burnout. 
I prefer to work alone for most projects, feel free to 
PR my stuff though.
